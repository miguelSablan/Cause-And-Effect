# Cause-And-Effect

Platformer Game Submitted to ShellHacks 2023

## Inspiration

We were inspired by a certain level in Titanfall 2 where the player had to travel between the past and present time periods to advance through the level and avoid certain hazards. We've decided to focus on that for our game.

## What it does

Our main mechanic, which we call "Time Flip", takes you between two different points of time in the exact same space. Using this, you will find certain obstacles be replaced in one time period with hazards in another time period, and you must switch between these time periods to advance.

## How we built it

We used Unity Game Engine to build it and C# for the scripts.

## Challenges we ran into

Our levels of ambition did not match our experience, providing a few walls for our project. Just as well, the time constraints forced us to be more conservative with our levels and mechanics to make the deadline.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The Time Flip mechanic is our greatest accomplishment, as it serves to provide interesting gameplay. As a consequence, it led to us making unique level choices to differentiate between the present and the future.

## What we learned

How to make player movement, tilemaps, animations, sprites, scene management.

## What's next for Cause & Effect

Possibly seeing if we can expand this game concept to a fully-functioning product.
